# JSL05 Project Brief: Task Board with Local Storage Persistence and Task Creation

## What Has Been Implemented

- **DOM Elements Populated:** The board columns ("To Do", "Doing", "Done") are dynamically rendered, and tasks are displayed in their correct columns.
- **Task Modal:** Clicking the "Add New Task" button opens a modal for creating a new task. The modal includes fields for title, description, and status, as required.
- **Add Task Button:** The "Add New Task" button is present in the header and styled to match the Figma design. It is positioned on the right side of the header.
- **Task Creation:** Users can add new tasks through the modal. The new task appears immediately in the correct column without a page refresh.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks are saved to local storage whenever a new task is added or edited. On page load, tasks are loaded from local storage and rendered in the correct columns.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout and modal are styled to be responsive and visually similar to the Figma design.
- **Modular JavaScript:** The code is organized into functions for rendering tasks, handling the modal, and managing local storage, following single-responsibility principles.
- **Descriptive Naming:** Variable and function names are descriptive for clarity and maintainability.

## How to Use

1. **Add a Task:** Click the "+Add New Task" button in the header. Fill in the task details in the modal and click "Save".
2. **Edit a Task:** Click on any task card to open the modal with its details, edit, and save.
3. **Persistence:** All tasks are saved in local storage and will remain after refreshing the page.

## Remaining Tasks

- Add JSDoc comments for all major functions and modules.
- Further modularize code if needed for larger projects.
- Test and refine mobile responsiveness for all screen sizes.

## Summary

This project now meets the requirements for persistent task storage, modal-based task creation, responsive design, and modular, maintainable code as outlined in the brief.
